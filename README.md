## Dependencies

You will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting Started

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/antkahn/flask-api-starter-kit.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

Then install dependencies and check that it works

```bash
$ make server.install      # Install the pip dependencies on the docker container
$ make server.start        # Run the container containing your local python server
```

If everything works, you should see the available routes [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/spec).

The API runs locally on docker containers. You can easily change the python version you are willing to use [here](https://github.com/antkahn/flask-api-starter-kit/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L4), by fetching a docker image of the python version you want.

## Commands

You can display availables make commands using `make`.

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `make server.start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

| `make <script>`      | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `help`               | Display availables make commands                                             |
| `server.install`     | Install the pip dependencies on the server's container.                      |
| `server.start`       | Run your local server in its own docker container.                           |
| `server.daemon`      | Run your local server in its own docker container as a daemon.               |
| `server.upgrade`     | Upgrade pip packages interactively.                                          |
| `test`               | Run unit tests with pytest in its own container.                             |
| `test.coverage`      | Run test coverage using pytest-cov.                                          |
| `test.lint`          | Run flake8 on the `src` and `test` directories.                              |
| `test.safety`        | Run safety to check if your vendors have security issues.                    |
| `format.black`       | Format python files using Black.                                             |
| `format.isort`       | Order python imports using isort.                                            |


## Application Structure

The application structure presented in this boilerplate is grouped primarily by file type. Please note, however, that this structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive.

```
.
├── devops                   # Project devops configuration settings
│   └── deploy               # Environment-specific configuration files for shipit
├── migrations               # Database's migrations settings
│   └── versions             # Database's migrations versions generated by alembic
├── src                      # Application source code
│   ├── resources            # Python classes containing the HTTP verbs of your routes
│   │   └── user.py          # Rest verbs related to the user routes
│   ├── routes               # Routes definitions and links to their associated resources
│   │   ├── __init__.py      # Contains every blueprint of your API

└── test                     # Unit tests source code
```

## Development

To develop locally, here are your two options:

```bash
$ make server.start           # Create the containers containing your python server in your terminal
$ make server.daemon          # Create the containers containing your python server as a daemon
```

The containers will reload by themselves as your source code is changed.
You can check the logs in the `./server.log` file.

## Testing

To add a unit test, simply create a `test_*.py` file anywhere in `./test/`, prefix your test classes with `Test` and your testing methods with `test_`. Unittest will run them automaticaly.
You can add objects in your database that will only be used in your tests, see example.
You can run your tests in their own container with the command:

```bash
$ make test
```

## Lint

To lint your code using flake8, just run in your terminal:

```bash
$ make test.lint
```

It will run the flake8 commands on your project in your server container, and display any lint error you may have in your code.

## Format

The code is formatted using [Black](https://github.com/python/black) and [Isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/). You have the following commands to your disposal:

```bash
$ make format.black # Apply Black on every file
$ make format.isort # Apply Isort on every file
```

## Swagger

Your API needs a description of it's routes and how to interact with them.
You can easily do that with the swagger package included in the starter kit.
Simply add a docstring to the resources of your API like in the `user` example.
The API description will be available [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/spec).
The Swagger UI will be available [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/apidocs/).
